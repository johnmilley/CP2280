// Exercise 2.34 Solution: PopulationGrowthCalculator.java
// Based on the current annual population growth rate and current
// world population, calcualte the world population after one, 
// two, three, four and five years.

// Note: Due to the size of the numbers and the percentage needed 
// to calculate population growth, this problem cannot be solved
// with int variables. So you'll need to tell your students to use
// type double and to input values with Scanner method nextDouble.
// Also, you should have them output the values using 
// System.out.printf and the format specifier %.0f.
import java.util.Scanner;

public class PopulationGrowthCalculator {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);
 
      // obtain weight in pounds and height in inches
      System.out.println("Welcome to the world population calculator");
      System.out.print("Enter the current world population: ");
      double currentPopulation = input.nextDouble();
      System.out.println("Enter the current growth rate");
      System.out.print("(e.g., 1.14% should be entered as .0114): ");
      double growthRate = input.nextDouble();

      // calculate and display future population numbers
      double futurePopulation = currentPopulation * (1 + growthRate);
      System.out.printf("%nAfter 1 year, the world population will be %.0f%n", 
         futurePopulation);
